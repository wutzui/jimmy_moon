# When the Moon Forgot.
Illustration book created by Jimmy Liao in 1999

A lonely boy finds the fallen moon in a field. He takes it home and cares for it, slowly helping it heal. They become inseparable companions, exploring the world together both day and night. But when the world needs the moon to remember its place in the sky, the boy must help it find its way back home.

The project responding to this illustration book is intended to expand the flat world into a comprehensive space that also remains its sense of isolation and loneliness. The goal is for the boy is push the moon back to the sky, but sometimes it could forget and fall down again, so he needs to be aware of it and keep push it up again and again.

A future plan for this project is to establish the whole city with buildings, the most interactive object between the moon and the boy that will tell a more comprehensive story.

For the process, I first modeled the boy character in Maya, and build the city buildings in Unity using cubes with textures which extracted from the book. Then I played with the C# script with the Game object and the valuables of the rigid body. The force that added to the moon is the main idea to the moon that makes it looks like floating but still falling down. The user experience and the interface are also important. I create two cameras that present different viewpoints. One is fixed in position, another is sticking with the boy, so whenever he goes, it will follow his eye view. The block on the left provide a basic information and tells the users what can they interact with it.
